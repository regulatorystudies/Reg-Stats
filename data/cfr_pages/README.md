# CFR Pages Data

## Update Instructions

The CFR pages data should be updated **once a year**. Since the date when the data for the latest year becomes available is unclear, check frequently during the first few months of each calendar year to see if the latest data are updated.

Follow these steps to update the dataset:

1. Visit the [Federal Register Statistics](https://www.federalregister.gov/reader-aids/federal-register-statistics) page. 
1. Select the XLS file under "Federal Register & CFR Publication Statistics â€“ Aggregated Charts" and save it to this folder
as "aggregated_charts_frstats.xlsx" (replace the existing file if necessary).
1. Run the Python script `update_cfr_pages.py` in your preferred IDE to update the dataset.

#### Environment Set Up

Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), the environment can be created and activated using the environment.yml file with the following commands in the terminal:

```{bash}
cd "NAVIGATE TO DIRECTORY WHERE YML IS STORED"

conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate regstats_cfr
```

See the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more details.
