# CFR Pages Data

## Update Instructions

The CFR pages data should be updated **once a year**. Since the date when the data for the latest year becomes available is unclear, check frequently during the first few months of each calendar year to see if the latest data are updated.

Follow these steps to update the dataset:

1. Check for updated data from the [Federal Register Statistics](https://www.federalregister.gov/reader-aids/federal-register-statistics) page. Select “Code of Federal Regulations Total Pages and Volumes 1938-XXXX.” A PDF will open. Scroll to the end of the table to see what is latest year with data available.
2. Compare the data in the PDF to the `cfr_pages_by_calendar_year.csv` file.
3. If new or revised data are available, make the necessary updates in the file, such as adding new years of data.
