Hello,

I am an academic researcher at the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center. One of the resources we provide to the public is summaries of regulatory data, located on our Reg Stats webpage.

For awhile, we have used the GAO CRA database to collect summary data on major rules received by GAO. I decided that it could be useful to have an automated way to collect these summary data, as well as a dataset of the underlying rules in the database. So I've been working on a web scraper that collects the rule data from the CRA database.

During this project, I noticed what could be a bug within the CRA database
