## Update Instructions

The data and graph of Federal Register pages should be updated annually. Since the date when the data for the latest year becomes available is unclear, check frequently in the first a few months of each calendar year to see if the latest data have been updated.

Follow these procedures to update the data:

1. Check for updated data from the [Federal Register Statistics](https://www.federalregister.gov/reader-aids/federal-register-statistics) page.
2. Under "Federal Register & CFR Publication Statistics â€“ Aggregated Charts," download the XLS file.
3. In the XLS file, save the first sheet "All Category Pages," which contains annual Federal Register pages, as a CSV file named `federal_register_pages_by_calendar_year.csv`.
4. If there are any updates or revisions from the original CSV file, push the changes to Github.
