# Federal Register Pages Data

## Update Instructions

The Federal Register pages data should be updated **once a year**. Since the date when the data for the latest year becomes available is unclear, check frequently during the first few months of each calendar year to see if the latest data have been updated.

Follow these steps to update the dataset:

1. Check for updated data from the [Federal Register Statistics](https://www.federalregister.gov/reader-aids/federal-register-statistics) page.
2. Under "Federal Register & CFR Publication Statistics â€“ Aggregated Charts," download the XLS file.
3. In the XLS file, save the first sheet "All Category Pages," which contains annual Federal Register pages, as a CSV file named `federal_register_pages_by_calendar_year.csv`.
4. If there are any updates or revisions from the original CSV file, push the changes to Github.
