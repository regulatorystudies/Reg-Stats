## Update Instructions

The graph of Federal Register pages should be updated annually. Since the date when the data for the latest year becomes available is unclear, check frequently in the first a few months of each calendar year to see if the latest data are updated.

Follow these procedures to update the data:

1. Check for updated data from the [Federal Register Statistics](https://www.federalregister.gov/reader-aids/federal-register-statistics) page. Select “Federal Register Pages Published (1936-XXXX) (PDF).” A PDF will open. Scroll to the end of the table to see what is latest year with data available.
2. Compare the data in the PDF to the Reg Stats spreadsheet, `federal_register_pages_by_calendar_year.csv`.
3. If new or revised data are available, make the necessary updates in the csv file, such as adding new years of data. Save the csv file.
