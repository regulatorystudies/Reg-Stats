" ++ Beginning Jan. 1, 2009, Correction documents were published within the document category of the document being corrected.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: Comparisons between the numbers of pages in early years' issues and those issued since the 1970s are complicated by several factors. Proposed rules were not required to be published until the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. The issue of January 1, 1947 was the first to have a Proposed Rule category.  Extensive preambles explaining rule documents were not common until the mid-1960s. The issues from the years 1936 - 1975 are not broken down by category and are not adjusted for blank or skipped pages.
