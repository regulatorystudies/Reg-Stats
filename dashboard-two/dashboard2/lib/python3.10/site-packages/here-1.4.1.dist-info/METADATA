# Here

Python package that replicates the R package called "here".

## Overview

The `here` package provides utility functions to determine the root directory of your project and easily resolve paths relative to it. This is particularly useful for managing file paths when calling the code from shells that `cd` to other directories before executing the script.

With `here` in R, you never ever have to deal with `setwd` junk.
With `here` in Python, you never ever have to deal with hard-coding full filepaths or working directory junk.

With both, you can define file paths *relative to the file that calls `here()` and it will always work!

## Features

- Determine the directory of the current file.
- Resolve paths relative to the root directory.
- Supports usage in Jupyter notebooks, .py scripts, and interactive Python shells.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade here
```

## Example Usage

```python
# Get the file working directory
file_working_directory = get_file_working_directory()
print(f"File working directory: {file_working_directory}")
>>> "/Users/michaelboerman/Code/here/here"

# Resolve a relative path using the here function
resolved_path = here("data/output")
print(f"Resolved path: {resolved_path}")
>>> "/Users/michaelboerman/Code/here/data/output"
```

It works on both .py and .ipynb files!
