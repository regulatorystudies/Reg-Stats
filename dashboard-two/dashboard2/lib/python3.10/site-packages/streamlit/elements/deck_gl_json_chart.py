    The schema for the PyDeck chart selection state.

    The selection state is stored in a dictionary-like object that supports

    programmatically changed or set through Session State.

    You must define ``id`` in ``pydeck.Layer`` to ensure statefulness when
    using selections with ``st.pydeck_chart``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    indices : dict[str, list[int]]
        A dictionary of selected objects by layer. Each key in the dictionary
        is a layer id, and each value is a list of object indices within that

    objects : dict[str, list[dict[str, Any]]]
        A dictionary of object attributes by layer. Each key in the dictionary
        is a layer id, and each value is a list of metadata dictionaries for
        the selected objects in that layer.

        When using this command, a service called Carto_ provides the map tiles to render
        map content. If you're using advanced PyDeck features you may need to obtain
        an API key from Carto first. You can do that as
        ``pydeck.Deck(api_keys={"carto": YOUR_KEY})`` or by setting the CARTO_API_KEY
        environment variable. See `PyDeck's documentation`_ for more information.

        Another common provider for map tiles is Mapbox_. If you prefer to use that,
        you'll need to create an account at https://mapbox.com and specify your Mapbox
        key when creating the ``pydeck.Deck`` object. You can do that as
        ``pydeck.Deck(api_keys={"mapbox": YOUR_KEY})`` or by setting the MAPBOX_API_KEY
        environment variable.

        .. note::
            Pydeck uses two WebGL contexts per chart, and different browsers
            have different limits on the number of WebGL contexts per page.
            If you exceed this limit, the oldest contexts will be dropped to
            make room for the new ones. To avoid this limitation in most
            browsers, don't display more than eight Pydeck charts on a single
            page.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pydeck_obj : pydeck.Deck or None
            Object specifying the PyDeck chart to draw.
        width : "stretch" or int
            The width of the chart element. This can be one of the following:

            - ``"stretch"`` (default): The width of the element matches the
              width of the parent container.
            - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The element has a
              fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of
              the parent container, the width of the element matches the width
              of the parent container.

        use_container_width : bool or None
            Whether to override the chart's native width with the width of
            the parent container. This can be one of the following:

            - ``None`` (default): Streamlit will use the chart's default behavior.
            - ``True``: Streamlit sets the width of the chart to match the
              width of the parent container.
            - ``False``: Streamlit sets the width of the chart to fit its
              contents according to the plotting library, up to the width of
              the parent container.

            .. deprecated::
               ``use_container_width`` is deprecated and will be removed in a
                future release. For ``use_container_width=True``, use
                ``width="stretch"``.

        height : "stretch" or int
            The height of the chart element. This can be one of the following:

            - An integer specifying the height in pixels: The element has a
              fixed height. If the content is larger than the specified
              height, scrolling is enabled. This is ``500`` by default.
            - ``"stretch"``: The height of the element matches the height of
              its content or the height of the parent container, whichever is
              larger. If the element is not in a parent container, the height
              of the element matches the height of its content.

        on_select : "ignore" or "rerun" or callable
            How the figure should respond to user selection events. This controls
            whether or not the chart behaves like an input widget.
            ``on_select`` can be one of the following:

            - ``"ignore"`` (default): Streamlit will not react to any selection
              events in the chart. The figure will not behave like an
              input widget.
            - ``"rerun"``: Streamlit will rerun the app when the user selects
              data in the chart. In this case, ``st.pydeck_chart`` will return
              the selection data as a dictionary.
            - A ``callable``: Streamlit will rerun the app and execute the callable
              as a callback function before the rest of the app. In this case,
              ``st.pydeck_chart`` will return the selection data as a
              dictionary.

            If ``on_select`` is not ``"ignore"``, all layers must have a
            declared ``id`` to keep the chart stateful across reruns.
        selection_mode : "single-object" or "multi-object"
            The selection mode of the chart. This can be one of the following:

            - ``"single-object"`` (default): Only one object can be selected at
              a time.
            - ``"multi-object"``: Multiple objects can be selected at a time.

        key : str
            An optional string to use for giving this element a stable
            identity. If ``key`` is ``None`` (default), this element's identity
            will be determined based on the values of the other parameters.

            Additionally, if selections are activated and ``key`` is provided,
            Streamlit will register the key in Session State to store the
            selection state. The selection state is read-only.

        Returns
        -------
        element or dict
            If ``on_select`` is ``"ignore"`` (default), this command returns an
            internal placeholder for the chart element. Otherwise, this method
            returns a dictionary-like object that supports both key and
            attribute notation. The attributes are described by the
            ``PydeckState`` dictionary schema.

        Example
        -------
        Here's a chart using a HexagonLayer and a ScatterplotLayer. It uses either the
        light or dark map style, based on which Streamlit theme is currently active:
