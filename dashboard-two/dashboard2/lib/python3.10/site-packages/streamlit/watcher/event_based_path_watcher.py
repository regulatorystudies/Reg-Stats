"""Declares the EventBasedPathWatcher class, which watches given paths in the file system.

How these classes work together
-------------------------------

- EventBasedPathWatcher : each instance of this is able to watch a single
  file or directory at a given path so long as there's a browser interested in
  it. This uses _MultiPathWatcher to watch paths.

- _MultiPathWatcher : singleton that watches multiple paths. It does this by
  holding a watchdog.observer.Observer object, and manages several
  _FolderEventHandler instances. This creates _FolderEventHandlers as needed,
  if the required folder is not already being watched. And it also tells
  existing _FolderEventHandlers which paths it should be watching for.

- _FolderEventHandler : event handler for when a folder is modified. You can
  register paths in that folder that you're interested in. Then this object
  listens to folder events, sees if registered paths changed, and fires
  callbacks if so.

This module is lazy-loaded and used only if watchdog is installed.

    Behavior differs based on whether watching a file or directory:

    allow_nonexistent=True, also detects file creation.

    **Directory watching:** Detects any file activity within the directory
    (creation, deletion, modification). The callback receives the actual
    changed file path (not the directory). Note that glob_pattern only affects
